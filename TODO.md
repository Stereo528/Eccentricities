# TODO List:

- Crate, large chest (maybe bigger?) in 1x1 block
- amethyst in enchanting (instead of lapis?)
- firework star + tnt = firework but like on the ground
- chance for blazes to drop blaze powder as well
- smooth glass blocks?
- green fire on copper (removes oxidation slowly?)
- Faster Walk Speed Block
- silk touchable amethyst bud blocks?
  - tiered versions (like that of ae2 certus buds)
- more sniffer plants
- savannah biome variants?
- stone cut stone into gravel, gravel to sand
  - needs tweaking beyond that
- Seven Wonders Advancement, visit 7 large structures
  - or at least 7 structures minus villages, (non-trail) ruins, shipwrecks


## MAYBE
- cactus plant-able on dirt and maybe terracotta, when the new block gets placed, turn into sand and red sand
- moss trim? (either color or design, maybe both)
- taller trees (like birch and spruce but for oak and stuff)
- mobs have chance for twins?
- ice aspect, gives frostburn or freezes entities in place
- Pillager Boat Structure (likely fixed wrecked ships? spawn on beach and ocean)
- end island height variance
- unenchant golden apple via grindstone
  - add advancement
- TNT powered elytra (owie)

# DONE
